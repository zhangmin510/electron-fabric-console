# Fabric Console 

[![JavaScript Standard Style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com)

Forked from [electron-api-demos](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos), 
which is a desktop app that interactively and with sample code demonstrates core features of the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) API. It's built with Electron, too, of course. This app works on Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

## Building

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer in order to build this app.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zhangmin510/fabric-console
$ cd fabric-console
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
